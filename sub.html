                This is a link to the <a href="https://bozone.com/">BOZONE</a> website. I want to take you out more, but I have no idea how. Please suggest things and I will be open to it all.
                I want to do the things that are important for you because whats important to you is important to me. This part of the website will be replaced with a map that includes pinpoints of places we've beean
                and photos attached to them.

                    <h2>About the Author</h2>
                    <h4>Warning! This was a 2 A.M. rant filled with insecurity and self pity, you do not have to read this. If you do, you do not have to respond or acknowledge that you read this. This rant invlovles overwhleming emotion.</h4>
                    <p> 
                        Scarlet, I'm sorry for being the asshole that I am. It's a part of me that I dont like, and I'm sorry for my impermissable actions. 
                        I am currently trying to take steps in not only improving communication, but also defining 'triggers' and recognizing where they come from.
                        I fear that you have doubts and my silence/attitude continues to trigger those and it makes it harder for you to put up with me.
                        There is only love for the person that you are; ambitious, kind, and open, so the fear is that you would find someone more deserving of 
                        the love you give. There are plenty, I'm sure, but I hope that you would share it with me. Though most of the time, I see what I did to you and 
                        never feel deserving. I fear that you are just waiting for me to see that so when you finally get rid of me I won't fight so hard this time. 
                        The fear is you giving up before you tell me and slowly watching you drift away. The wish is for you to never feel afraid to share secrets with me because
                        of my unpredictability or because I wouldn't be receptive to it or because I don't share enough of them with you. I want you to feel valued, respected, and safe with me. 
                        The wish is for us to share everything and I want to use this weekend to prove to you that I can be that person, that I can be your person. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I love you, Scarlet. I often make it hard to believe that we have the same meaning, because of the lack of understanding I have on the word. I truly love you, and would do anything for you. 
                        I appreciate your jokes, you are genuinely funny. I appreciate waking up next you and watching your face brighten up when you get to think about your next nap. I appreciate your passionate stance
                        about what you beilieve but also how you remain neutral enough to take in new information. I appreciate your patience, your love for the outdoors, and the way you shine brighter than the sun.

                        This website is a letter. A letter from who I hope is your best friend, from who I hope is your only lover, and from who I hope is 
                        a person you want to spend forever with. All I have is hope because I find it hard to believe in anything. I understand that it's an insecurity,
                        I don't believe I'm the only one, I don't beliieve I'm your bestfriend, I don't believe you want this for forever. The faint dream is that because these 
                        things are my truth about you, I hope they reciprocate. It scares me that you may never feel how I do about you. I try to make up for my negatives with
                        overwhelming positives, I'm afraid to be neutral because of how close it is to negative, I'm afraid that you'll find a man who is everything you want with none of the drawbacks I hold.
                        But then we sing a song together,  or we share a laugh and a hug and I feel as though we are the only people in the entire world. The only thing i ever want from you is you. Nothing more, and, Lord willing, nothing less.
